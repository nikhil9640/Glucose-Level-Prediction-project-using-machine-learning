# Glucose-Level-Prediction-project-using-machine-learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's glucose level is high (â‰¥126 mg/dL) or normal, based on various clinical and demographic features from the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The dataset includes health metrics such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, age, and more, making it suitable for early identification of individuals at risk for conditions like type 2 diabetes.
By building and evaluating multiple machine learning models, the project aims to assist in risk stratification and early intervention, which are critical for managing chronic diseases.

## Project Objective
To build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model that classifies glucose levels as high or normal
To explore relationships between glucose and other health indicators using EDA
To compare the performance of different classifiers including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

To identify and visualize important predictive features

To demonstrate the use of ML techniques in healthcare applications, with a focus on preventive care
